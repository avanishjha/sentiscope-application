At 3k it's overpriced. I got for Rs 2300. Build quality is very good. Good music and calling for the price. It's a base heavy earbuds. Vocal and lows also good but not great. ANC is for the namesake. I have real buds air 2 which I had got around Rs 1600 launched 2yr ago has better ANC and same music quality only issue with calling. I purchased this only for bual device switching. If dual switching is not priority then there are better sounding and ANC product under at 2300. Battery is good. No issue with fitting. For me after 20-30min ear start paining.
